        <h1>Devabhaktineni Sayendranadh Chowdary</h1>
        <h6> favorite spot :- Himalayas</h6>
        <p>
            Home to some of the highest peaks in the world, the Indian Himalayas offer absolutely<b>breathtaking views </b> across its diverse landscape.
            Feast your eyes on winding roads zigzagging their way through the mountain ranges, strands of brightly colourful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze
            and vividly-hued trucks wending their way across the passes.
            The panoramas from Kanchenjunga the world third tallest mountain and Nanda Devi, 
            a World Heritage Site and the <b>highest mountain</b> located entirely within India are particularly mesmerising.
            Dont forget to pack layers of clothing for the changeable weather and to always stay with a guide who knows the route.
